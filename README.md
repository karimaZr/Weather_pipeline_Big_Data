# Orchestration of a Big Data Pipeline for Data Visualization

This project represents an orchestration of a Big Data pipeline for data visualization by integrating various powerful technologies, each playing a specific role in the data processing and visualization workflow.

## Technologies Used

- **Apache Airflow** for task orchestration
- **Kafka** for real-time data streaming
- **Cassandra** for distributed storage
- **Spark SQL** for large-scale data processing
- **Spark ML** for applying machine learning models
- **Streamlit** for interactive data visualization

## Architecture

## how to run

1. Clone this repository: `https://github.com/IkramEddamnati-dev/Weather_pipeline_Big_Data.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Weather_pipeline_Big_Data`
3. Convert the file `entrypoint.sh` to Unix format using:  
   `dos2unix ./script/entrypoint.sh`
4. Run: `docker-compose up -d`
5. Run: `docker cp dependencies.zip spark-master:/dependencies.zip`

## Execution

1. Access the Airflow interface in `http://localhost:8086/home` and run the DAG:

2. In the Kafka UI, you can view the topics that have been created. To do so, navigate to the following URL: `http://localhost:8085/ui/clusters/local/all-topics`
   You should be able to see the list of topics created in your Kafka cluster.

3. The data will be stored locally in Parquet file format.
4. isualizations of the data from the Parquet files will be displayed in Streamlit. ![WhatsApp Image 2024-12-10 at 22 11 28](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7dd7aef5-5b65-425c-8f5e-6bdbf2caa4b1) ![WhatsApp Image 2024-12-10 at 22 11 54](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/90b7e4df-3708-4caf-ad4c-73ad9be50bb6) ![WhatsApp Image 2024-12-10 at 22 12 42](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ec20804-b625-4204-8c4a-3e181165f997) ![WhatsApp Image 2024-12-10 at 22 13 25](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bbdb936c-3e6a-4fe9-84e1-711294d55bf7)![WhatsApp Image 2024-12-10 at 22 19 42](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/38cbe09f-363f-4f0d-8100-00222e6d7f97)

5. The data will then be aggregated using Spark SQL and sent to Cassandra. You can verify this by executing the following commands:`docker exec -it cassandra cqlsh -u cassandra -p cassandra localhost 9042` and `SELECT count(*)FROM spark_streaming.weather_data;` ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/720fd8ec-326d-4a1c-9b99-973b5a218e5f)
6. Afterward, our pre-trained offline model will predict new factors, and these predictions will be stored in Cassandra.
7. Finally, a visualization comparing the actual values with the predicted ones will be displayed in Streamlit.
